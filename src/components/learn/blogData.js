      <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has done it again. In its latest deep field observation, the telescope has uncovered evidence of galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</p>
      <p>These ancient structure, known as "green pea" galaxies due to their small size and distinct color, are challenging our understanding of how the early universe evolved. Unlike modern spiral galaxies like our Milky Way, these primitive galaxies are chaotic and dense, churning out stars at a furious rate.</p>
      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>By studying these early galaxies, astronomers hope to solve the mystery of "cosmic reionization"—the period when the first stars ignited and cleared the fog of neutral hydrogen that filled the universe. JWST's infrared capabilities allow it to peer through this cosmic dust, seeing further back in time than any telescope before it.</p>
      <p>This discovery is just the beginning. As JWST continues its mission, we expect to find even older and more distant objects, potentially revealing the very first stars to shine in the cosmos.</p>

        description: "New evidence suggests Mars once had flowing water.",
        date: "15/01/2026",
        content: `
      <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has struck gold—or rather, mud. Analysis of rock samples collected from the Jezero Crater indicates that the area was once a rich river delta, filled with flowing water and potentially capable of supporting life.</p>
      <p>The samples contain sulfates and clays, minerals that typically form in the presence of water. Even more intriguing, the chemical signature suggests the water was fresh, not salty, making it an ideal environment for microbial life.</p>
      <h3>The Search for Life</h3>
      <p>While no direct evidence of ancient microbes has been found yet, these samples are being stored for a future sample return mission. If they can be brought back to Earth, scientists will be able to analyze them with far greater precision than the rover's onboard instruments allow.</p>
      <p>"This is the strongest evidence yet that Mars was once a blue world like Earth," said Dr. Sarah Al-Ahmed, a planetary geologist. "It raises the question: where did the water go, and did life go with it?"</p>

      <p>SpaceX has successfully launched another batch of next-generation Starlink satellites, promising faster speeds and lower latency for users worldwide. This latest generation features inter-satellite laser links, allowing data to travel between satellites at the speed of light in a vacuum—faster than fiber optic cables on Earth.</p>
      <p>The goal is to provide high-speed internet to the most remote corners of the globe, from the research stations of Antarctica to ships in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
      <h3>Impact on Astronomy</h3>
      <p>While the service is a boon for connectivity, it has raised concerns among astronomers about light pollution. SpaceX is working with the scientific community to develop "darkSat" coatings and orientation maneuvers to minimize the satellites' reflectivity and impact on night-sky observations.</p>

        date: "15/01/2026",
        content: `
      <p>It has been a quarter of a century since the first module of the International Space Station (ISS) was launched into orbit. Since then, it has been continuously occupied by rotating crews of astronauts from around the world.</p>
      <p>The ISS serves as a unique microgravity laboratory, hosting experiments that cannot be done on Earth. Research conducted on the station has led to breakthroughs in medicine, materials science, and our understanding of the human body.</p>
      <h3>The Future of the ISS</h3>
      <p>As the station ages, plans are being made for its eventual retirement in the early 2030s. NASA and its partners are looking to commercial space stations to take up the mantle, ensuring that humanity maintains a permanent presence in low Earth orbit.</p>

      <p>When we look up at the night sky, we might see a moving star—a satellite orbiting our planet. But these machines are doing far more than just floating in space; they are the silent backbone of modern civilization.</p>
      <h3>Weather Forecasting and Disaster Management</h3>
      <p>Meteorological satellites provide real-time data on cloud cover, storms, and atmospheric conditions. This allows for accurate weather forecasts that save countless lives by providing early warnings for hurricanes, typhoons, and floods. In the aftermath of disasters, imaging satellites map affected areas, helping rescue teams locate victims and plan relief efforts.</p>
      <h3>Communication and Connectivity</h3>
      <p>In our hyper-connected world, satellites bridge the gap. They beam TV signals, facilitate international phone calls, and provide internet access to remote areas where laying cables is impossible. They are the invisible threads tying the global economy together.</p>
      <h3>Environmental Monitoring</h3>
      <p>Satellites are our eyes in the sky for monitoring the health of our planet. They track deforestation in the Amazon, measure rising sea levels, and monitor air quality in cities. This data is crucial for understanding climate change and enforcing environmental regulations.</p>
      <p>In short, space technology isn't just about exploring the unknown; it's about improving life right here on Earth.</p>
